[Project_Files](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1kvHQ99CDDWfGoYLaHBDNn3eacqtT84nn?usp=sharing)

This repository implements core genomics algorithms using both Python and Verilog. It features a Python-based FM-Index pipeline for pattern searching and a Verilog hardware module for Burrows-Wheeler Transform (BWT) simulation on FPGA.

-  FM-Index (Python): Suffix Tree, Suffix Array, BWT, C/OCC tables, Backward Search
-  BWT Module (Verilog): Bitwise 2-bit DNA encoding, hardware-level suffix sorting and output decoding
-  Includes simulation results, waveforms, and power/utilization reports
